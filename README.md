# GreenSteps
GreenSteps is a system that helps universities monitor and manage their carbon footprint from electricity. This system will generate a monthly report in a form of .txt, displaying the amount of carbon footprint produced by universities. It also allows the admin to limit the usage of electricity in certain rooms (e.g Air Conditioner, Lamp, etc).
